# Automate your Git Initialization

```bash
git clone https://github.com/piyush072/git-automation
cd git-automation
pip install -r requirements.txt
source commands.sh
create repository_name public #to create a public repository
create repository_name private #to create a private repository
```

This will create a project folder locally and a private repository on GitHub. Just replace the username and password in the commands.sh and create.py.
